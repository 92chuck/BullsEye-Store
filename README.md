# Bullseye

<em>Hey there! Thanks for checking out Bullseye.</em>
<em>This project was originally built by a team of 4 including me. I decided to rebuild the frontend to strengthen my HTML and CSS skills and build a website that does not fully depend on a frontend library like MaterialUI. I also wanted added more features, such as a search bar and added new product categories and backend functionality. Please check out the deployed project below and I hope you enjoy the presentation!</em>
